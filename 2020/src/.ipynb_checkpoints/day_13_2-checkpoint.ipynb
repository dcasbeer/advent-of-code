    "Let the index of the bus be given by its (zero-indexed) location in the list. For example, with a list \"17,x,13,19\", Bus 0 is $b_0=17$, Bus 2 is $b_2 = 13$ and Bus 3 is $b_3 = 19$. We want to find a timestamp $t$, such that Bus 1 leaves at that timestamp, and all other buses leave at timestamp $t + i$, where $i$ is the index of the bus. In this example, Bus 1 would leave at time $t$; Bus 2 would leave at time $t+2$; and Bus 3 would leave at time $t+3$. \n",
